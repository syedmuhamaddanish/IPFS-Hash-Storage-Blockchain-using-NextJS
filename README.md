## Installation

After you cloned the repository, you want to install the packages using

```shell
npm install
```

You first need to compile the contract and upload it to the blockchain network. Go to https://remix.ethereum.org/, and deploy the smart contract on your choice of blockchain. Copy and paste the abi and contract address along with rpc-url of the blockchain network in constant.js. Also get the private key from your metamask account. 


Once you have done everthing above, simply run the following command to make the server running

```shell
npm run dev
```
